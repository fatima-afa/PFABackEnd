<h2>E-Banking Application - Backend</h2>
<p>Welcome to the backend repository of our E-Banking application. In this README, we will provide an overview of the project, share the class diagram, use case diagram, and explain the microservices architecture implemented using the Spring Boot framework</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains the backend components of our E-Banking application.</p>
<h2>Class Diagram</h2>
<p>Here, we present the class diagram of the backend services. This diagram provides an overview of the key classes and their relationships, helping you understand the structure of our application.</p>
<p>Because the diagram is large, I've decided to break it down into smaller sections. However, you can view the entire diagram via this link:</p>

<h4>Microservices Architecture</h4>
<p>Our E-Banking application follows a microservices architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Spring Boot is utilized as the primary framework for building these microservices. Below is an overview of the microservices involved:</p>

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>

- **Java:** We utilized Java as the primary programming language for building our backend services.

- **Spring Boot:** Our application is built on the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development of production-ready applications with Spring.

- **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose was used to orchestrate our MySQL database and PHPMyAdmin containers, simplifying the setup and management of our database environment.

- **MySQL:** Our choice of database management system for storing and retrieving data.

- **PHPMyAdmin:** We used PHPMyAdmin to interact with and manage our MySQL database visually.
